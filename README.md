# Custom table #

## Goals ##

* To provide an html view template to configure table columns (as opposed to a configuration object)
* To enable fetching child rows and have them rendered into the same table at the appropriate point
* To allow for row functionality to be configured via callbacks to the controller
* To provide common functions such as clone, archive, delete that can be handled by services via the controller
* To provide pagination
